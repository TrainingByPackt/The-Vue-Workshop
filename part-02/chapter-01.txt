If we have followed the previous part of this Vue workshop,  we already know how to initiate a Vue project with Vue CLI. However, even if this is the first time we have met, Vue CLI still gives us straightforward guidance during the initiation process.

We can start with:
---
vue create first-vue-app
---
The prompt will ask for information, follow the instruction, and we will have the very first application.

Run the project by:
---
cd first-vue-app
yarn serve
---

Please note that Vue CLI version 3.10.0 has a bug which causes our dev server runs with a new, random port number every time we run the project. Please follow the note at the end of this chapter to find a workaround.

Before we dive into coding, give some time to plan is a good practice in programming. Below is a diagram of the application we are going to build.

In the diagram, we have an App.vue component that wraps multiple Message.vue components, a text input, and a 'Send' button inside. We call the Message.vue components are the children of App.vue component.

Create Message.vue component:
---
<template>
  <div class="message-wrapper">
    <p class="message-content">
      This is the content
      <small>12.8.2019</small>
    </p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
};
</script>

<style lang="scss">
</style>
---
